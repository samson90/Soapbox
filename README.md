# Soapbox

Website I created for users to post videos on various political topics. Videos are divided into pro and con fields and users upvote videos that they like the most. I use the Youtube to host the videos and store the videoID in the database.

To show off the video page, I used some example videos straight off of youtube. The topic is 'Should the U.S. legalize gay marriage.'
